 ### [Purple Shark - A Bash Script For PCAP Analysis - Cybersecurity](https://youtu.be/lnBnNEV4Jtg?si=XWF8AOJOdi72xIYA)

<h2>Description</h2>
purpleShark.sh is a Bash Script that automatically extracts useful network traffic data from a PCAP file. PCAP files can be hard to read and analyze, so my team and I automated the process as part of our Graduation Project at Fullstack Academy. The script consists of 120 lines of Bash code and extracts network traffic data from a PCAP file using TShark. YOU MUST HAVE TSHARK AND ZENITY INSTALLED IN ORDER TO RUN THIS PROGRAM!!!
